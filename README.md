# LRJ PurpleBook

### Training material:

刘汝佳紫皮书 (no English version available, sorry)

### Training Plan:
- In general: `Algorithm and Data Structure` => `Data mining interview questions` => `Probability and Statistics` => `Advanced Machine Learning Topics`
- This training material only contains `Algorithm and Data Structure`. I used it several years ago when I was preparing for algorithm contest `ACM-ICPC`. I forgot most of the contents though.
- I prefer a step-by-step, systematic and solid training with this book. But I may use LeetCode 3 or 4 weeks later. In Python & C++.
- `Algorithm and Data structure` training plan: `simulations` => `some C++ STL` => `data structure` => `advanced algorithm` . Language:  `C++` and/or `Python`.
